Called number script backed up all called numbers, SIP handles and other call commands. 

0.2.0: 07/07/2015- Combined a simple cleanup script with a called numbers backup script.
     Added ability to auto detect changes in favorites file.
     User's lpc files are now in ~/.lpc instead of loose in $HOME.
     Systemwide and user specific config files allow  for customization.
0.3.0: 15/09/2015- Menus added to guide the user through lpclic configuration changes and open history files for manual editing.

0.3.1: 07/12/2015- Option to append last used commands on to cleanedup history is added.
Configuration menu is mostly finished.

0.4.0: 15/06/2016- Menus are finished and tested except for history length limit which which now sends an under development message.
Help is changed from a place holder msg to a hopefully useful explanation of available options.
First time run now does not lose oldest commands in ~/.linphonec_history when building initial optimized history file.
Configuration files are now sourced so that options missing in a user's lpc.conf file wil be read from the system lpc.conf.
Menus are now displayed in a more readable manner with input and output on separate lines, menu titles and some blank line separation
where appropriate.
Status messages are added to inform the user of some actions taken.

0.4.0.1: 16/06/2016- Consecutive duplicate commands are removed from last used before appending to history file 

0.4.0.2: 19/06/2016- Bash completion added as an opt dependency in arch-linux package
Bugs fixed due to leftover ref to .lpc dir.

0.4.0.3: 20/06/2016- Last refferences to ~/.lpc have been removed. Hopefully lpclic is bug free for now.

0.4.0.4: 20/06/2016- Minor improvements to comments 
Menus always display in single column list instead of showing in a 3 column grid on first open.

0.5.0: 21/06/2016- Rudamentary bash-completion files are included.
Probably won't make bash-completions mandatory till a bit more powerful files are shipped.

0.5.0.1: 22/06/2016- Improved completion for linphonec.
Manpage updated to mention completion functionality.

0.5.0.2: 22/06/2016- Linphonec -s now completes dialed numbers.
Manpage update will wait for next release.

0.5.0.3: 23/06/2016- Bug fixed that made it near imosible  to change favorites file from config menu.
The -s option that started linphonec with out processing cmd history has changed to -S so that new option -s can be used to start a call when linphone is 
launched. This was done to be consistent with the linphonec -s option.  


ToDo- Finish hist length limit function.
Improve history cleanup to catch more typos and cases where a command is typed on a line wher a command already exists.
Add calls completion file.
Consider adding some functionality to change global linphone configuratioin by automating some edits to linphonerc.
Posibly add an option to append favorites on to cleanedup history instead of prepending it.
Add a commandline option to start linphonec with favorites and/or last called only for users who normally keep their whole command history.
Port menus to ncurses so that items can be selected with out typing numbers.
Eventually look at integration of features in to linphonec itself.
